Epidemic Simulation

This project implements an epidemic simulation model on networks using Python, NetworkX, and Matplotlib.
It allows users to simulate how an infection spreads across a network of connected nodes, with customizable parameters such as infection probability, recovery time, and immunity duration.

The simulation is visualized step by step on a graph, where each node represents an individual and edges represent possible transmission paths.

âœ¨ Features
	â€¢	ðŸ¦  Customizable epidemic model
	â€¢	Infection probability (ptrans)
	â€¢	Recovery time (tREC)
	â€¢	Immunity duration (tSUS) â€“ can also be infinite
	â€¢	ðŸŽ² Random initial infections â€“ select the number of initially infected nodes randomly from the network
	â€¢	ðŸ“Š Tracking infection spread â€“ count infections per node and identify superspreaders
	â€¢	ðŸŽ¨ Graph visualization â€“ animated step-by-step simulation with color-coded states:
	â€¢	ðŸŸ¢ Susceptible
	â€¢	ðŸ”´ Infected
	â€¢	ðŸŸ  Recovered
	â€¢	ðŸ“‚ CSV-based graph loading â€“ define the network edges in a .csv file
