Epidemic Simulation on Graphs

This project implements an epidemic simulation on graphs using NetworkX
.
The model follows infection, recovery, and return-to-susceptibility dynamics, and visualizes the epidemic evolution with Matplotlib
.

🚀 Features

Load a graph from a .csv edge list file.

Random selection of initially infected nodes.

Customizable parameters:

Infection probability (ptrans)

Number of steps to recover (tREC)

Number of steps of immunity (tSUS, with option for infinity ?)

Step-by-step visualization with node colors:

🟩 Susceptible

🟥 Infected

🟧 Recovered

Final statistics:

Infection count per node

Identification of potential superspreaders

Option to restart simulations with the same or new parameters.

📊 CSV file format

The graph is defined by an edge list with headers source and target.
Example (test.csv):

source,target
1,2
2,3
3,4
4,5
2,5

▶️ Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/epidemic-simulation.git
cd epidemic-simulation


Install dependencies:

pip install networkx matplotlib pandas


Run the script:

python epidemic_simulation.py


🛠️ Technologies

Python 3.x

NetworkX
 → graph management

Matplotlib
 → visualization

Pandas
 → CSV file handling

📌 Notes

The simulation ends when there are no infected nodes left or after 100 steps (to prevent infinite loops).

If no node spreads the infection, there are no superspreaders.
